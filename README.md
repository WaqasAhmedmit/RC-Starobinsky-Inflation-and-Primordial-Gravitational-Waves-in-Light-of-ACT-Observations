## ðŸ“– Abstract

This work studies the impact of bosonic quantum corrections on nonminimally coupled quartic inflation. We show that corrections from scalar fields (e.g., a Higgs portal) shift the predictions for the primordial spectral index (`n_s`) and tensor-to-scalar ratio (`r`) into excellent agreement with the latest combined datasets from **ACT DR6**, **Planck**, and **BICEP/Keck**. The model is equivalent to the Starobinsky model and provides a viable pathway for generating observable primordial gravitational waves.
